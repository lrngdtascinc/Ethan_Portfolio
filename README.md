## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Isolation Forest for DDoS Detection 

  My role in my groups final project is to do the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and build a machine learning model. The end goal is to take the DDoS data that we acquired and mold it into a usable and more understandable data frame to give us a better idea how DDoS attacks work under the hood, and to build an intrusion detection system, using machine learning to identify outliers in the networking data to better catch DDoS attacks in the future. 
  
  * Used Pandas and Matplotlib to explore and better understand the network traffic dataset.
  * Used Feature Engineering to prepare the data for machine learning.
  * Used Scikit Learn to build an Isolation Forest to detect outliers in the dataset.
