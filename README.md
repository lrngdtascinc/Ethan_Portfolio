## [Project 1: DDoS Detection with Python](https://github.com/Brotherscodes/Cyber_Security_Intrusion_Prevention.git) 

  My role in my groups final project is to do the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and build a machine learning model. The end goal is to take the DDoS data that we acquired and mold it into a usable and more understandable data frame to give us a better idea how DDoS attacks work under the hood, and to build an intrusion detection system, using machine learning to identify outliers in the networking data to better catch DDoS attacks in the future. 
  
  * Used Pandas and Matplotlib to explore and better understand the network traffic dataset.
  * Used Feature Engineering to prepare the data for machine learning.
  * Used Scikit Learn to build an Isolation Forest to detect outliers in the dataset.

## [Project 2: SQL Queries for Company Training](https://github.com/lrngdtascinc/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-.git)  
The main goal of this analysis was too format the data from Pewlett-Hackard and go thru it to figure out how many employees are about to retire, and to find which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This will help streamline the process of assigning mentors to those who are eligible to save the company time and money.

  * Analyzed the data from Pewlett-Hackard to identify primary and foreign keys.
  * Wrote SQL queries to put together the Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database.

## [Project 3: Visualizing Citi-Bike Data with Tableau](https://github.com/lrngdtascinc/NYC-Citi-Bike-Analysis.git)
The purpose of this analysis is to show to investors that a bike sharing business model would be successful in Des Moines Iowa by gathering the bike data and putting together a couple of visualizations in a Tableau story. Going thru the Tableau story we can see many patterns emerge that shoq that creating a bike sharing business in Des Moines would most likely be a profitable idea.

  * Built Charts to analyze Citi-Bike Trips
  * Created a comprehensive story using visualizations for a final presentation.
